                                    Humans are different from other species in our ability to construct the environment to our needs and desires. We are neither the fastest nor the strongest in the animal kingdom, yet our paved roads and cars make us the undisputed champions in both by far. Our ingenuity has helped us surpass all other species, and has allowed us to tailor the entire Earth to our needs. But one day, we will not only be able to mold our surroundings in our benefit; we will be able to automate it, enabling it to actively serve us, further elevating our standard of living. The technology is on the horizon, most notably Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, and it will soon replace nearly all forms of labor, freeing humanity from its obligation to work.
                                    </br></br>
                                    This vision seems like a far-off, or even fanciful dream, but in fact, technology that exists right now has already replaced many of the routine tasks in our society such as car manufacturing, and before long, artificial intelligence will become powerful enough to replace many of our other currently “irreplaceable” jobs. Considering the recent unrelenting exponential developments in technology, this transition to automation is indisputably inevitable.
                                    </br></br>
                                    However, depending on its execution, this mass replacement of traditionally human jobs could either be a huge boon to the human race or spell a major socio-economic disaster; it is equal parts exciting and terrifying. This is, after all, turning thousands of years of human wisdom in civilization building — the idea that people must work — on its head. Yet, this is not a transition without precedence. At one point during the Roman Empire, a mass influx of slavery to the primarily agrarian society displaced the large farming middle class and forced them into unemployment. Faced with widespread social unrest, the Roman government proclaimed free ‘Panem et Circenses’ or ‘Bread and Circuses’ — a form of ancient social welfare. The Roman Empire lasted for another four hundred years before it finally fell by no fault of its internal social programs, speaking volumes to the viability of their solution.
                                    </br></br>
                                    Today, the middle and lower classes are at risk of being replaced by robotics and artificial intelligence — the modern equivalent of cheap, endless labor. Conceivably, the greatest danger in the rise of automation might be the fact that if a large enough proportion of the population becomes unemployed, the economy will experience a great slow-down. As people become unemployed and begin to spend less and less, companies will move more towards automation to save cost, thus displacing even more jobs and creating a self-feeding cycle. Many possible solutions have been proposed, but perhaps the most realistic, and most time tested, is a universal basic income like that of the Roman ‘Panem et Circenses’.
                                    </br></br>
                                    Many experiments for a basic income program have already taken place in different parts of the world, and, contrary to popular beliefs, they have actually helped increase local employment rates. [1] In impoverished areas of the world, the newfound income was able to revitalize the local economy, thus raising the overall standard of living. The hope is that promoting job automation as well as providing a basic income as the two complementary parts of a new-age society will not only lead to a stronger economy, but also a modern renaissance lead by artists, creators and others who work for the joy of their craft and are no longer held back by the responsibilities of putting food on the table.
                                    </br></br>
                                    To afford this universal basic income, companies will be rated on an index of automation, and will be taxed for higher utilization of Robots and Artificial Intelligence. Corporations will no longer be at the mercy of labor unions and the changing tides of human resources, and the employed will no longer be at the mercy of the employers. Students and researchers can afford to stay in academia for longer and thus raise the creative output of humanity as a whole. Because the health of an economy is characterized by how often value exchanges hands, the labor stability afforded by automation and the taxation and wealth redistribution under this new society will not only rid us of the obligation to work, but will also increase our total productivity as a species. Human progress will reach new heights under this new social order.
                                    </br></br></br>
